<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Cluster Analysis</h1>

</div>


<p>As our final multivariate method, let’s apply cluster analysis to our data. This will allow us to use our subset of variables to find clusters of teams in multidimensional space. Then, we can analyze these clusters for common characteristics and potential predictions of tournament success.</p>
<div id="hierarchial-cluster-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Hierarchial Cluster Analysis</h2>
<p>To start, let’s complete some hierarchial cluster analyses with various distance and agglomeration methods. To do so, we create a generalized data set and function, try several different metric combinations, and analyze the results, choosing an appropriate number of clusters and considering their meaning.</p>
<div id="euclidean-distance-and-complete-linkage" class="section level3">
<h3>Euclidean Distance and Complete Linkage</h3>
<p>First, let’s consider using a basic Euclidean distance metric along with complete linkage. We can see that this results in a well-structured dendrogram with distinct clusters and a relatively “bushy” tree. Now, considering the number of clusters to retain, we visually see either <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> distinct subtrees we could separate into. However, looking at the plot below, we see that the RSSTD statistic seems to take a local minimum value at around <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, where the SPR and RS graphs also seem to flatten out. Upon trying both <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> clusters, <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> seemed to provide a better degree of separation between groups in both principal component and discriminant function space, confirming <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> groups as the correct choice.</p>
<p>Now, considering potential interpretations for these clusters, we see that Cluster 1 has a high proportion of teams who ended up with low seeds and a high number of tournament games played, implying that the characteristics of this group yield general tournament success. Cluster 2 is the largest group, encompassing teams with many different seeds and varying levels of tournament success. However, this group does contain the eventual champion Virginia, as well as the runner-up Texas Tech; thus, this group could also contain high achieving teams. Cluster 3 seems to contain mostly higher-seeded teams that only played a few tournament games, with notable standouts of Auburn and Purdue. However, being grouped with these teams would generally imply a lesser overall quality and hence lower chance of success.</p>

<h3>Manhattan Distance and Complete Linkage</h3>
<p>Now, to consider other distance metrics, let’s try using Manhattan distance while keeping complete linkage agglomeration. In this case, we see a much more extented dendrogram in terms of greatest distance between clusters, though it visually has similar levels of bushiness. In terms of number of clusters to retain, this tree is much more ambiguous, as all the plotted metrics are very flat, with few extrema. From the tree structure, there seems to be <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> significant subtrees (a cluster count where the RS plot seems to flatten out a bit as well), so we decide to keep <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> clusters. Additionally, while the approximate confidence ellipses overlap significantly at any cluster count over <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, the discriminant function plot retains a large level of separation for our choice of <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> groups.</p>
<p>Compared to the Euclidean distance results, the groups here are quite different (which is obviously a result of additional groups as well). This Cluster 1 <strong>(note: the group order does not matter)</strong> contains some of the low seed teams, like North Carolina, as well as some of the highest performing teams, like Texas Tech. However, it also has some middle seed teams with only a game or two played, so it is not a surefire success group. The second group generally has high seed teams with few games played, with the notable exception of the Kentucky Wildcats. However, being in this group generally implies a lower level of success. Cluster 3 contains even more lowly teams, with mostly double-digit seeds and single games played (notably Fairleigh Dickinson played <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> games but one was a play-in game). Cluster 4 has similar characteristics to Cluster 3 with slightly higher performance, even including eventual champion Virginia (implying Virginia’s unique characteristics among successful teams). However, being in either of these groups generally implies a low level of team success (don’t pick these teams for your bracket unless they are truly top seeds). On the other hand, Cluster 5 is comprised of generally successful teams with low seeds and many games played.</p>

<h3>Euclidean Distance and Single Linkage</h3>
<p>In this case, we see a very “stringy, chain-like” dendrogram that is very sensitive to outliers. Each successive grouping seems to add only one team or a small subtree, so the number of clusters is relatively arbitrary (as evidenced by the flat plots up to high cluster numbers). Adding additional clusters similarly adds the next most “unique” team, generally those of highest and lowest seeds (with anything up to <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> clusters, the individual teams are <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(16\)</span> seeds, with the seed numbers growing upwards and downwards, respectively, after that). Since choosing <span class="math inline">\(8\)</span> clusters depicts the greatest outliers, such as tournament favorite Duke and biggest underdog North Carolina Central, and several very successful teams, such as Michigan State and Auburn, we will retain <span class="math inline">\(8\)</span> clusters.</p>
<p>Now, while this method is useless in terms of creating larger groups with similar characteristics, it is actually incredibly useful for predicting tournament results. By picking out the outliers, it not only outlines pre-tournament favorites and “non-favorites” but also seems to predict outliers in terms of tournament success. Most notably, we see Auburn is among these <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-team groups, one of the Cinderella or surprise teams who went far in the tournament despite having a relatively high seed. Thus this technique may be very useful for picking out successful teams (ignoring the abnormally “bad” teams and admitting a bias towards pre-tournament favorites).</p>

<h2>K-Means Cluster Analysis</h2>
<p>While the hierarchial cluster analysis above was incredibly useful, it would also be very informative to look at a much greater pool of teams from multiple years. This is technically possible using the techniques above, but here we will do it in a much easier and quicker way using k-means cluster analysis.</p>
<p>Below, using a modified version of the script by <a href="https://github.com/mpeeples2008/Kmeans">Matt Peeples</a>, we complete k-means cluster analysis on all the tournament teams with complete data from the 2014-15 to 2018-19 seasons. Looking at the two plots provided by this script, we see that the sum of squares vs. number of clusters flattens out at about <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> (for log scale) or <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> (for normal scale) clusters. Since the <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> cluster solution is more interesting to interpret and still shows significant distinction on the principal component and discriminating function plots, we choose to retain <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> clusters.</p>
<p>In this case, we see that Cluster 1 contains mostly middle seeds with mediocre tournament performance, with the exception of some “Cinderella” Final Four teams like 7 seed Michigan State in 2014-15, 10 seed Syracuse in 2015-16, and 7 seed South Carolina in 2016-17. Looking at the cluster means, we see that Cluster 1 has significantly lower adjusted averages for most offensive statistics (points, true shooting percentage, efficiency, etc.). However, their defensive statistics (opponent points, true shooting percentage, efficiency, etc.) are relatively average, with means of about <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. Interestingly, while their adjusted winning percentage is expectedly low, their opponent winning percentage and strength of schedule are high, along with slightly above average RPI values. This implies that these teams are quality defensive teams with mediocre offenses who come from strong conferences. While their tournament performances are not stellar, membership in this group does imply the possibility of being a “Cinderella” team.</p>
<p>Cluster 2 teams generally seem to have lower seeds and better tournament performance, but there are still teams of all sorts. However, we see one champion in 2018-19 Virginia and three runner-ups in 2018-19 Texas Tech, 2017-18 Michigan, and 2014-15 Wisconsin, implying the possibility of strong performance. Despite this success, this cluster seems to have low offensive statistics, with the lowest points and efficiency. However, they have by far the strongest defensive statistics, with adjusted opponent points and efficiency means around <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>. Finally, their composite statistics (adjusted winning percentage, opponent winning percentage, strength of schedule, RPI) are slightly below average, probably due to the large range of teams. Overall, the hallmark of this group is strong defense, which seemingly can allow for both outstanding and mediocre tournament performances.</p>
<p>Then, Cluster 3 is by far the lowest performing with the highest seeds, containing few exceptions. Fittingly, this is also the largest group, including many teams eliminated in the first two rounds. This cluster has generally mediocre offensive statistics along with poor defensive statistics. Furthermore, all of their composite statistics are significantly below average, implying both low performance and lowly competition. The only major exception comes from the 2018-19 Auburn team, which reached the Final Four, but this team is a known outlier from our previous clusters and thus does not seem to imply any silver lining for this low-performing group.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Cluster 4 is the highest performing and lowest-seed cluster, including the fewest early eliminations, two champions in 2015-16 and 2017-18 Villanova, and two runner-ups in 2015-16 North Carolina and 2016-17 Gonzaga. Likewise, these teams are the most well-rounded statistically, having very high offensive performance and generally strong defense as well. Notably, their composite statistics are also generally the highest, implying strong performance against good (if not always great) competition. If we were to pick a decisive “winner” group, this would be it.</p>
<p>Interestingly, these groups are all similarly-sized, perhaps reflecting some of the classic “randomness” of the tournament. But the existence of such clear and interpretable groups imply that there are significant patterns, even across multiple years (albeit with some expected “noise” in each cluster).</p>
