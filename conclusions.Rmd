Overall, our multivariate analyses were very successful, with valid data and interesting results. In contrast to the perceived randomness of the tournament, we were able to deduce strong patterns according to expected trends, with higher seeds and better regular season teams performing better in the tournament (especially in the case of 1 seeds). Additionally, we saw a lot of Cinderella teams coming from 7, 10, and 11 seeds, who generally played difficult schedules in large conferences. In terms of variables, we saw that advanced offensive statistics like true shooting percentage and efficiency were generally the best predictors of success, reflecting the offensively-dominated modern game. Thus, while certainly not a silver bullet for predicting March Madness results, we were able to paint an illustrative picture of the tournament as a whole, encompassing the teams, the variables, the seeds, and the rounds.

## Factor Analysis
The factor analysis was relatively successful, with high suitability of our data and reasonably consistent and strong factors. The interpretations were relatively clear and illustrated interesting relationships among our indicators. Most notably, the results affirmed strong connections between overall regular season success and overall tournament success, continuing to undermine the narrative of fully random tournament results. While PCA suggested $5$ latent factors, we could have potentially tried only $3$ factors, as the interpretations for the final $2$ were much less clear and the correlations much weaker; however, the existence of the "aggression" factor and its negative correlation with tournament success was quite informative, making a case for these less prominent factors.

## Ordination
The ordination study was also quite successful, demonstrating clear and informative plots of our team groupings in two and three dimensions. Furthermore, we saw very strong correlations with our continuous team statistics, verifying their use as predictors and also the validity of our plots themselves. The most useful results probably came from the two-dimensional non-metric multidimensional scaling, which was slightly more linear and connected than the correspondence analysis results. The fitting of continuous variable contour plots only furthered this connection and demonstrated the heavy interactions between regular season statistics and tournament success. Thus, while not a direct modeling technique itself, ordination has allowed us to observe and analyze useful trends across several factors.

## Cluster Analysis
Continuing our pattern of success, the cluster analysis was also insightful, with each chosen technique providing interesting yet different results and conclusions. The most useful investigations probably came from the outlier distinction of single linkage hierarchial clustering, which was able to determine potential favorites, Cinderellas, etc., and from the k-means analysis including all of the teams. While these results are certainly not a conclusive solution to predicting every tournament, there are clear correlations between different types of teams, and the resulting clusters seem to have significant predictive ability.
